CSIS 2440 - Web Programming
======
This repo mainly serves as a archive for all the coursework I did in CSIS 2440 at Salt Lake Community College in December 2021. The final project is a mock e-commerce site that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end and PHP, and MySQL for the back-end. The web server is now defunct and as such the files are posted only to reference the server-side code. 

Features:
----------------
- Connects to an external database that holds information on registered users and products for sale.

- Uses cookie and session data to dynamically generate the client-side code for account login/creation, shopping cart, and checkout functionality.

- User passwords created with and secured with a salted SHA-256 hash. **Account features are no longer supported and the database no longer exists.**

- Uses JavaScript and regex validation to provide real-time feedback on user input fields.

To Do:
----------------
- There is a possibility I may find a new hosting solution for this project so I can provide a live demo. Certain authentication methods would be have to be changed and the database rebuilt.
